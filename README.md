 Git
-----
This repository contain some git submodules. Don't forget to pull and initialize them!
```bash
# make sure you always check out the submodules
git config --global submodule.recurse true

# clone this repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/DO1JLR/ansible_weechat_setup.git

# clone and initialize and update submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Or simply update via ``make update``!

To install ansible simply run ``sudo make install``!

Have a look into the ``group_vars`` Folder and change the variables - if needed.

A look into the README files of the submodules may help!

To deploy the weechat on a empty server simply deploy the site.yml playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml
```
